# Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor Machine Learning Models
As an assignment of our 5th semester Open Source Lab in Btech CSE course, this project was made that predicts Car Prices using the Machine Learning Models:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor

Steps involved in the making of this project :

1. Data Preprocessing.
2. Splitting data set into Training and Testing Sets.
3. Training our Models.
4. Evaluation of our trained models by calculating the R_squared error score of both models.
5. Visualisation of the Predicted and Actual values on a regression line.
